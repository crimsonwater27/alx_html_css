# alx_html_css
Take a look through my alx_html_css wherein lies all my hard work in my attempt to replicate the SmileSchool webpage, from writhing the raw HTML, writing and linking the style.css, deside colors, spacing, and correctlty adding the images intheir required spaces.
I've learned quite a bit through this exercise and I am exited to continue on the development road!
